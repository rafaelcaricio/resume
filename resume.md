Summary
-------

I'm an experienced full-stack web developer with passion for software development in general. I have been working for more than 7 years in the area and have deployed to production several projects for many companies based in Europe, USA, and South America. In projects, I successfully work within a group as well as by myself. I am self motivated and always focused on achieving the best results.

I'm passionate about writing testable code and creating automated tools to improve my team's productivity. I have helped several open source projects like PIP (community most used Python Package Manager), PyVows (BDD tool for Python), Thumbor (Imaging Manipulation Server), and many others.

Averaging 65 million unique visitors and 1.4 billion pageviews per month.

Education
---------

* **[Universidade Federal de Pernambuco](http://www2.cin.ufpe.br/)** (2009 - 2010)
  *MSc Software Engineering*

  Although I have finished all the disciplines with high grades, I never wrote the final thesis. When I had to write my thesis I also had the most stressful period in my company, so I had to choose on what to focus. I had chosen to dedicate myself to my professional career and develop the product we had created. This degree is *incomplete*.

  - I worked as a teacher assistant in the discipline of Laboratory of Oriented Programming.


* **[Faculdade Integrada do Recife](http://portal.estacio.br/unidades/faculdade-estacio-do-recife.aspx)** (2005 - 2008)

  I was a very disciplined student with good grades and always focused on my studies. All teachers liked me because of my dedication and discipline. I was invited by the teachers to become mentor of a few disciplines during my graduation and I have helped many students with their difficulties during the studies.

  - I worked as a teacher assistant of Discrete Mathematics between September/2005 and November/2005.
