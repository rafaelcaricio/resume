Summary
-------

I'm an experienced full-stack web developer with passion for software development in general. I have been working for more than 7 years in the area and have deployed to production several projects for many companies based in Europe, USA, and South America. In projects, I successfully work within a group as well as by myself. I am self motivated and always focused on achieving the best results.

I'm passionate about writing testable code and creating automated tools to improve my team's productivity. I have helped several open source projects like PIP (community most used Python Package Manager), PyVows (BDD tool for Python), Thumbor (Imaging Manipulation Server), and many others.

  *MSc Software Engineering*

  Although I have finished all the disciplines with high grades, I never wrote the final thesis. When I had to write my thesis I also had the most stressful period in my company, so I had to choose on what to focus. I had chosen to dedicate myself to my professional career and develop the product we had created. This degree is *incomplete*.

  - I worked as a teacher assistant in the discipline of Laboratory of Oriented Programming.

I was invited by the teachers to become mentor of a few disciplines during my graduation and I have helped many students with their difficulties during the studies.

  - I worked as a teacher assistant of Discrete Mathematics between September/2005 and November/2005.
