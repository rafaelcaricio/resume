Summary
-------

I'm an experienced full-stack web developer with passion for software development in general. I have been working for more than 7 years in the area and have deployed to production several projects for many companies based in Europe, USA, and South America. In projects, I successfully work within a group as well as by myself. I am self motivated and always focused on achieving the best results.

I'm passionate about testing and automated tools to improve my team's productivity and mine. I have helped several open source projects like PIP (community most used Python Package Manager), PyVows (BDD tool for Python), Thumbor (Imaging Manipulation Server), and many others.

  Althrought I have finished all the disciplines with high grades, I never wrote the final thesis. By the time to write the thesis I had the most stressful period in my company and I had to choose on what to focus. I had chosen to dedicate myself in my professional career and develop the product we had created. This degree is *incomplete*.

I was invited by the teachers to become mentor of few disciplines during my graduation and I have helped many students with their difficulties during the studies.

  - I worked as teacher assistant of Discrete Mathematics during the period of September/2005 until November/2005.
